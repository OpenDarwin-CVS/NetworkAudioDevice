 Network Audio Driver for Darwin (Mac OS X)

 Copyright Sam O'Connor <samoconnor@mac.com>

 Implements an IOAudioDevice with a single output stream that sends
 aduio to an esound (esd) server.


ABOUT

 The intention of this driver is to take all the audio output from one computer
 (eg an iBook with an airport card) and send it to another computer (eg an old
 Linux box hooked up to a stereo). This makes it easy to listent to music,
 watch movies etc on the laptop while utilising the nice speakers hooked up to
 the stereo.


WARNING

 THIS IS A KERNEL DRIVER, IT HAS ONLY HAD LIMITED TESTING
 IT MAY CRASH YOUR MAC AND YOU MAY LOOSE ALL YOUR DATA

 You have been warned. During development I hav crashed my iBook dozens of
 times but have not actually lost any data thanks to having journalling
 turned on (and luck).


USAGE

 Currently, the address of the esound server is hard-coded in
 NetworkAudioEngine.cpp (look for ESD_HOST)

 To install do:

 make install

 make load

 (or build with project builder and use kextload to load the kext.)

 then select "Network Audio Driver" as sound output device in the "Sound"
 system preferences panel. You will either get sound comming from your
 esound server, messages in /var/log/system.log or a hard crash.


THANKS

 Thanks to all those who showed interest and provided invaluable advice
 on the darwin-drivers mailing list. In particular,
